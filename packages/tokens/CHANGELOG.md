## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5674b0f: Establish the 0.2.0 canonical design-system contracts.

  This release line intentionally removes compatibility APIs from 0.1.x: Motion uses semantic roles, Tokens use canonical component and typography namespaces, Glass is reduced to subtle/elevated/immersive, Vue removes UiGlassSurface and the glass-card preset, the Glass runtime drops historical aliases, and theme selection uses data-theme only.

  It also promotes the React adapter and Giscus theme packages to public package boundaries, adds first-class tokenized `UiTable` and `UiDisclosure` contracts across Vue and React, and includes the refined component, material, accessibility, and Design Lab contracts validated for the 0.2.0 migration.

  Motion now owns the shared enter/exit Presence engine and interruptible page View Transitions, including optional WebGL2 Particle Dissolve with capture/synthetic pipelines, crossfade fallback, and reduced-motion handling. Vue exposes `UiPresence`, `presence`, and `staggerStyle`; React exposes `UiPresence` and `useUiPresence`. Framework adapters share Motion presets and lifecycle cleanup rather than defining separate animation recipes.
